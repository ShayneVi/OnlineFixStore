Welcome all to my Online fixes game store! 
You will not find any games here, only online fixes in
an ease of use store. Enjoy!

Everything is free and will stay free forever. I do this as
a hobby and do not get money or ask money for it. 

All credits goes to online-fix.me sites and team. Thanks to them this is possible.
The app was created with the help of claude AI. Check it out, it has a free tier.

Since everything is free, there is a couple of things to take in
consideration. The fetching of game images and names on the store pages
is slower and thus you will have to give it time to load everything on launch.
Thank you for being patient.

I will leave a link to the luatools discord server. Check it out
if you want free games the easy way. Their tool and plugin are
a great addition to anyone and goes well with this store.

-----METACRITIC SCORE-----
Not all games have metacritic user scores.

-----CO-OPTIMUS INFO-----
Not all games have co-op info on co-optimus. If there is a game that doesn't have the right info, please do message me in contact with info on the coop of the game in this format.
Game Name
Max Number of Players - online - local - Campaign mode

-----INSTALLATION----
When you download a fix, it will instantly install it. Select your game folder.

---INFO---
Right now there is 700+ games. I am adding more every week, until
all the games in online-fix.me are there.
There may be some exceptions as I upload these fixes to my github and
the maximum a file can be on free plan is 50mb. So there is already
a couple of games I couldn't upload the fixes.

If you have a game that doesn't have a fix here, but has one on 
online-fix.me site, feel free to contact me for it. I will see
if the fix is too large to upload, hence why it wasn't there.

It may also happen that I passed over a couple of games, if it happened,
again contact me and I will add it. 

If you also have a problem where the fix you downloaded doesn't
work anymore, please do contact me. It could be because the game
was updated and the fix either doesn't work anymore, which I will
remove from the list of games, or that the fix was also updated -
which I will update as soon as I can.

Before opting to message me for a fix not working, please do check the online-fix.me page of the said game, translate the page in English and check the section "playing through" as it may be that you need the Microsoft store version of the game hence why it doesn't work.
