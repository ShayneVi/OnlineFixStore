## Important Notes

### Loading Times
Since everything is free, fetching game images and names from Steam takes time. **Please be patient during initial load** - the app caches data for faster subsequent launches.

### Metacritic Scores
Not all games have Metacritic user scores available.

### Co-Op Information
Co-Op data comes from Co-Optimus. If a game has incorrect or missing co-op info, please contact me with:
- Game Name
- Max Number of Players - Online - Local - Campaign Mode

### Installation
When you download a fix, it will automatically install. Just select your game folder when prompted.
For bypasses, you download the folder, extract it and copy its content to your game's folder. 
Some may have more to do, make sure to read the read me text that comes with it.

### Game Availability
Currently features **700+ games** with more added weekly. Some games may be missing due to:
- File size limitations (GitHub free plan has 50MB limit per file)
- Occasionally overlooked games

If a game is missing or a fix isn't working, please contact me with the details and I will look into it.

## Troubleshooting
